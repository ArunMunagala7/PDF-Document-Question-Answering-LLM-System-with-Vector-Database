# PDF Document Question Answering LLM System with Vector Database
 
PDF Document Question Answering System with LLM (GPT-4) and Vector Database Integration

This project focuses on building an advanced PDF document query system empowered by the Language Learning Models (LLM), specifically GPT-4, integrated with LangChain. The system efficiently stores and retrieves PDF document data using vector databases like Apache Cassandra and DataStax.

Key Components:

Language Learning Model (LLM - GPT-4): Integrated GPT-4 to facilitate comprehensive PDF document understanding and precise question-answering capabilities.

LangChain Integration: Implemented LangChain to harmonize the integration of GPT-4 within the system. LangChain will streamline the interaction with the language model for document comprehension and question answering.

Vector Database (Apache Cassandra, DataStax): Utilized robust vector database systems like Apache Cassandra and DataStax for optimized storage and retrieval of PDF document data. These databases will enable efficient indexing and querying of document vectors.
